## Hardware Overview

This mmwave sensor is compatible with the full range of XIAO, so the pin definitions follow the XIAO pin definitions. However, considering the widespread use of serial ports, we have designed a soft serial connection for the mmwave sensor.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/mmwave-for-xiao/2.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

The sensor relies heavily on the soft serial ports (D2 - TX, D3 - RX) and a 3.3V power supply. Other than that, none of the other pins will be used.

## Getting Started

This sensor module supports both direct software viewing (via Bluetooth) and secondary development (using XIAO and UART). If you want to observe the sensor values as soon as possible, you can refer to the **Getting Started** steps to use the software we provide.

## Hardware Connections

The sensor is designed for XIAO compatibility, so in general, if you want to use this sensor, you need to prepare an XIAO and install the female header row pin for the sensor. When connecting to the XIAO, please pay special attention to the installation direction of the sensor, please do not plug it in backwards, otherwise it is likely to burn the sensor or the XIAO.

:::caution
The correct direction to follow is that the antenna of the sensor should face outwards.
:::

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/mmwave-for-xiao/5.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

After confirming that the connection direction is correct, you can connect the USB-C type cable to the computer or power supply, and the sensor will start to work.
