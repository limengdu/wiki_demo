## Getting Started

### Firmware Version Updates

The mmwave sensor has undergone a long period of technical precipitation and valuable suggestions provided by users, and we have been iterating on the original product to provide more accurate and reliable monitoring results and a better experience for our users.

Newly shipped sensors are shipped with the latest firmware by default to ensure the latest product experience. However, for the sake of the old user experience, we hereby provide the latest firmware and update method to ensure that you can use our latest technology.

#### Universal method - use J-link to burn firmware

If you encounter the wrong firmware or radar anomaly, firmware malfunction, etc., using this method to re-flash the firmware is the most effective way.

**Download of the latest firmware**

| Firmware Version | Download Address |
|:----------------:|:----------------:|
| Jlink_MR24HPC1-20230302.bin | [Download](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/new_res/Jlink_MR24HPC1-20230302.bin) |

:::caution
1. Please check the function of your product carefully, please do not mix with other mmwave sensors to brush this firmware, otherwise it may cause abnormal product function, the consequences need to be your own responsibility!

2. Please also note that different ways of updating the firmware use different firmware content, what you are downloading is the firmware burned via **J-link**.
:::

**To update your radar to the latest version**

**Step1.** You will need to have a **Jlink** and **MR24HPC1** 24GHz mmWave Sensor.

Connect the radar and Jlink together via Dupont wire as shown in the diagram below.

<div align="center"><img width ="600" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/57.jpg"/></div>

**Step2.** Download the necessary software and firmware.

| Pack_Segger_AT32F4xx_v1.3.3.zip | [Download](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/Pack_Segger_AT32F4xx_v1.3.3.zip)

**Step3.** Unzip **JlinkV644e.rar** and open the **JLink_Windows_V644e.exe** file inside.

Just follow the default options to install. Once the installation is complete, start the **J-Flash V6.44e** software.

**Step4.** Install the chip package.

Unzip **Pack_Segger_AT32F4xx_v1.3.3.zip** and open **Segger_AT32F4xx_AddOn.exe** inside.

<div align="center"><img width ="600" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/47.png"/></div>

:::tip
If you meet error like the picture below when adding something to JFlash, you can follow the instruction below to solve the problem.
:::

<div align="center"><img width ="600" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/arteryMcu.png"/></div>

Solution:

1. Download this file from https://www.arterychip.com/en/product/AT32F403A.jsp

2. Unzip the file and open

3. Copy JLinkDevices.xml from C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLink_V794 to C:\Users[User]\AppData\Roaming\SEGGER

This fixes the problem and we can flash with JFlash or JFlash Lite software.

**Step5.** Create a new project.

<div align="center"><img width ="600" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/48.png"/></div>

<div align="center"><img width ="600" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/49.png"/></div>

Find and choose **AT32F403ARGT7**.

<div align="center"><img width ="600" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/50.png"/></div>

<div align="center"><img width ="600" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/51.png"/></div>

**Step6.** Drag and drop the radar firmware (.bin file) into this software and a window will pop up, we will just use its default starting address of 0x8000000.

<div align="center"><img width ="600" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/52.png"/></div>

**Step7.** Clink **Target** -> **Connect**

<div align="center"><img width ="600" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/53.png"/></div>

When the connection is successful it will show Connected successfully.

<div align="center"><img width ="400" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/54.png"/></div>

Erase firmware: **Target** -> **manual Programming** -> **Erase Chip**

<div align="center"><img width ="600" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/55.png"/></div>

Upgrade firmware: **Target** -> **manual Programming** -> **Program & Verify**

<div align="center"><img width ="600" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/56.png"/></div>

At this point, the firmware update is complete.

#### Update firmware via UART

Considering that J-link is expensive, it is too extravagant to buy a J-link for the vast majority of users who only need to update their radar firmware, so we offer an update method via UART.

**Download of the latest firmware**

| Firmware Version | Download Address |
|:----------------:|:----------------:|
| UART_MR24HPC1-20230302.bin | [Download](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/new_res/UART_MR24HPC1-20230302.bin) |

:::caution
1. Please check the function of your product carefully, please do not mix with other mmwave sensors to brush this firmware, otherwise it may cause abnormal product function, the consequences need to be your own responsibility!

2. Please also note that different ways of updating the firmware use different firmware content, what you are downloading is the firmware burned via **UART**.

3. Make sure your radar firmware version is **at least version G24VD1SYV001006** before using the UART to upgrade the firmware, otherwise it may disable the radar, at which point you'll have to use J-link to burn the firmware to use it!

You can query the firmware version number information by sending the command `0x53 0x59 0x02 0xA4 0x00 0x01 0x0F 0x62 0x54 0x43` to Radar. The data reported by the radar is then displayed as a string, and you will see an effect similar to the one shown below.

`G24VD1SYV000009` is the model number reported on the radar, where `000009` is the version number. This means that this sensor **not** supports UART upgrade.

<div align="center"><img width ="400" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/new_img/21.png"/></div>
:::

**To update your radar to the latest version**

**Step 1**. You will need to have a **UART to USB** and **MR24HPC1** 24GHz mmWave Sensor.

Connect the radar and UART to USB together via Dupont wire as shown in the diagram below.

<div align="center"><img width ="600" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/uart.png"/></div>

**Step 2**. Download the necessary software and firmware.

| File | Download Address |
|:----------------:|:----------------:|
| PackageMake-v1.1.1.zip | [Download](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/new_res/PackageMake-v1.1.1.zip) |

**Step 3**. Unzip the package PackageMake-v1.1.1.zip and open the PackageMake-v1.1.1.exe file inside.

Connect the UART to USB with the sensor connected to the computer, click the gear pattern in the upper left corner of the software, select the port number, set the baud rate to 115200, and then click the bottom right corner to confirm. (If the port number is not found, check the connection and then click the refresh button in the lower left corner to retry)

<div align="center"><img width ="450" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/new_img/11.png"/></div>

  </tbody></table>

In addition to the serial software mentioned above, you can also use the [upper computer software](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Radar_MR24HPCB1/Human-Radar-Open-Protocol_2.0.exe) designed for radar directly.

The following ten sections explain the role of each part of the software.

<div align="center"><img width ="{800}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Radar_MR24HPCB1/7.png"/></div>

1. Port

    Select the port to which the radar is connected to the computer. It is usually necessary to **Refresh** the port by clicking the Refresh button before selecting it. Once selected please click on the **Open** button.

2. Baud rate

    The MR24HPC1 radar needs to be set at a baud rate of 115200.

3. Motion Energy

    This value is equivalent to the **dynamic value**. The variation in this value represents the constant motion noise in the environment. The Motion Energy is low when there is no one in the space, and the overall Motion Energy gets higher as the motion increases in magnitude and distance.

4. Exit Energy

    This value is equivalent to the **static value**. The variation in this value represents the constant statics noise in the environment. Exit Energy are low when the space is unoccupied, and overall Exit Energy fluctuate at higher values when there is a stationary person in the space (slight movement of the chest breathing).

5. Distance

    **Stationary distance**: The straight line distance between the environment and the radar in the presence of a slightly moving area. When there is someone stationary at a location in space, the straight line distance from the radar is output in real time.
    **Movement distance**: The straight-line distance between a moving position in the environment and the radar. When there is a person in motion at a location in space, the straight line distance from the radar is output in real time for that location. the straight-line distance from the radar.

<div align="center"><img width ="{800}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Radar_MR24HPCB1/9.png"/></div>

6. Graphics Settings

    Used to clearly determine the relationship between real-time waveforms and thresholds relationship. Based on the real time curve changes, it is possible to observe the change in floor noise in different states of the space, and based on the change in floor noise it is possible to set the threshold for the presence of the human body and make a simple judgement of the presence/absence/activity of the stationary state.

<div align="center"><img width ="{800}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Radar_MR24HPCB1/8.png"/></div>

7. Inquiry

    Search for the current parameter settings. For the meaning of the individual parameter values, please refer to the user manual for details for reasons of space.

8. Settings

    Set the threshold values for each parameter.

9. Status Display

    This window shows the current distance, speed and movement status in real time, among other values.

10. Send & Reply

    The data frames sent and received.

## Sensor development with Arduino

### Arduino Library Overview

:::tip
If this is your first time using Arduino, we highly recommend you to refer to [Getting Started with Arduino](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Getting_Started_with_Arduino/).
:::

The library code used in this example can be downloaded by clicking the icon below.

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><a href="https://github.com/limengdu/Seeed_24GHz_Human_Static_Presence_Module_Lite" target="_blank"><div align="center"><img width ="{300}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/seeed_logo/DOWNLOAD.png" /></div></a></p>

#### Function

Before we get started developing a sketch, let's look at the available functions of the library.

- `void recvRadarBytes()` ‚Äî‚Äî This function collects the data frames reported by the Sensor via the UART according to the frame headers and frame tails in the Sensor data protocol. Used in conjunction with the `showData()` function, the collected data information can be printed out via the serial port.

  - **Input parameters:** None

  - **Return value:** None

- `void showData()` ‚Äî‚Äî This function serves to print out the complete data frame reported by the Sensor at once via the serial port and needs to be used in conjunction with the `recvRadarBytes()` function.

  - **Input parameters:** None

  - **Return value:** None

- `void HumanStatic_func(bool bodysign /*=false*/)` ‚Äî‚Äî This function is responsible for parsing the data frames of the Sensor and outputting the relevant data on the state of the human presence.

  - **Input parameters:** `bodysign` ‚Äî‚Äî This parameter is a switch that controls whether or not to output Human Movement Parameters. If **true**, the output will contain a large amount of human sign parameter data, which may affect your experience of viewing the data. By default this parameter is **false** and no information on the body sign parameters is displayed.

  - <span id="jump2"><strong>Return value:</strong></span>

    - `int radarStatus` ‚Äî‚Äî The value returned indicates which status class the parsed data frame belongs to. The specific categories can be found in the **Default Variables** section.

    - `int bodysign_val` ‚Äî‚Äî The value returned represents the value of the Human Movement Parameter. This value is only valid with the parameter `bodysign=true`.

    - `int static_val` ‚Äî‚Äî This value is equivalent to the **static value**. The variation in this value represents the constant statics noise in the environment. Exit Energy are low when the space is unoccupied, and overall Exit Energy fluctuate at higher values when there is a stationary person in the space (slight movement of the chest breathing). This value is only valid if the Open Underlying Message is on.

    - `int dynamic_val` ‚Äî‚Äî The variation in this value represents the constant motion noise in the environment. The Motion Energy is low when there is no one in the space, and the overall Motion Energy gets higher as the motion increases in magnitude and distance. This value is only valid if the open underlying message is on.

    - `int dis_static` ‚Äî‚Äî The straight line distance between the environment and the Sensor in the presence of a slightly moving area. When there is someone stationary at a location in space, the straight line distance from the Sensor is output in real time. This value is only valid if the Open Underlying Message is on.

    - `int dis_move` ‚Äî‚Äî The straight-line distance between a moving position in the environment and the Sensor. When there is a person in motion at a location in space, the straight line distance from the Sensor is output in real time for that location. the straight-line distance from the Sensor. This value is only valid if the Open Underlying Message is on.

    - `int speed` ‚Äî‚Äî This value indicates the speed of movement of the moving object. The value is for reference only. This value is only valid if the Open Underlying Message is on.

- `void checkSetMode_func(const unsigned char* buff, int len, bool cyclic /*= false*/)` ‚Äî‚Äî This function can be used to send data frames to the Sensor. The data frames sent and the data frames returned are printed out via the serial port.

  - **Input parameters:**

    - `buff` ‚Äî‚Äî The data frame you want to send to the Sensor.

    - `len` ‚Äî‚Äî The length of the data frame you want to send to the Sensor.

    - `cyclic` ‚Äî‚Äî Cyclic send switch. The default is false, which can be set to **true** if you wish to send this data frame cyclically.

  - **Return value:** None

- `void reset_func()` ‚Äî‚Äî The function serves to reset the Sensor.

  - **Input parameters:** None

  - **Return value:** None

**Step 2.** In the menu bar in the upper left corner of the Arduino IDE, select **tool**, choose the type of development board you are using, and select the corresponding serial port.

:::tip
If you are using **MacOS**, the serial port name of the device will often start with **/dev/cu.usbmodem xxx**, ending with the name of the device. If you are using **Windows**, the device's serial port name will often begin with **COM**, again ending with the device's name.

In this example, we will demonstrate how the Sensor works with our popular product XIAO nRF52840 Sense.

### Demo1: Serial port printing of raw data frames from Sensor output

This example will guide you through the process of printing out the raw data reported by the Sensor via the serial port.

The following example program is in the examples folder of the library called **MR24HPCB1_rawdata_print**.

```c
#include "Arduino.h"
#include <humanstaticLite.h>

//#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
// Choose any two pins that can be used with SoftwareSerial to RX & TX
//#define RX_Pin A2
//#define TX_Pin A3

//SoftwareSerial mySerial = SoftwareSerial(RX_Pin, TX_Pin);

// we'll be using software serial
//HumanStaticLite radar = HumanStaticLite(&mySerial);

// can also try hardware serial with
HumanStaticLite radar = HumanStaticLite(&Serial1);

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial1.begin(115200);

  //  mySerial.begin(115200);

  while(!Serial);   //When the serial port is opened, the program starts to execute.

  Serial.println("Ready");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  radar.recvRadarBytes();           //Receive radar data and start processing
  radar.showData();                 //Serial port prints a set of received data frames
  delay(200);                       //Add time delay to avoid program jam
}
```

In this program, we are using the XIAO nRF52840's hardware **Serial1** port to connect to the Sensor and use the hardware **Serial** port Serial to output data, so we need to initialise this serial port separately in the initialisation function `Setup()`.

In the main `loop()` function we use the function `recvRadarBytes()` to receive data frames from the Sensor and then use the `showData()` function to print out the received data frames via the serial port.

In this program, it is important to note that there is an interval between the reception and output of every two data frames to avoid a jam on the main board. This time should be no less than **150ms**.

This means that there is no way for the main board to receive all the data frames reported by the Sensor, but as the number of frames reported by the Sensor is very large and frequent, this does not affect the accuracy of using the Sensor to determine the environment.

Upload program. Opening your serial monitor to a baud rate of 115200 should show the result. The output should look something like the below image.

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Radar_MR24HPCB1/1.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### Demo2: Serial port printing of parsed human presence information

In this example, we will use the functions in the library to parse the received data frames and print out all the feature data reported by the Sensor active via the serial port.

The following example program is in the examples folder of the library called **MR24HPCB1_parsed_rawdata**.

```c
#include "Arduino.h"
#include <humanstaticLite.h>

//#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
// Choose any two pins that can be used with SoftwareSerial to RX & TX
//#define RX_Pin A2
//#define TX_Pin A3

//SoftwareSerial mySerial = SoftwareSerial(RX_Pin, TX_Pin);

// we'll be using software serial
//HumanStaticLite radar = HumanStaticLite(&mySerial);

// can also try hardware serial with
HumanStaticLite radar = HumanStaticLite(&Serial1);

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial1.begin(115200);

  //  mySerial.begin(115200);

  while(!Serial);   //When the serial port is opened, the program starts to execute.

  Serial.println("Ready");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  radar.HumanStatic_func(true);    //Turn on printing of human movement sign parameters
  if(radar.radarStatus != 0x00){
    switch(radar.radarStatus){
      Serial.println(radar.radarStatus);
      case SOMEONE:
        Serial.println("Someone is here.");
        Serial.println("---------------------------------");
        break;
      case NOONE:
        Serial.println("Nobody here.");
        Serial.println("---------------------------------");
        break;
      case NOTHING:
        Serial.println("No human activity messages.");
        Serial.println("---------------------------------");
        break;
      case SOMEONE_STOP:
        Serial.println("Someone stop");
        Serial.println("---------------------------------");
        break;
      case SOMEONE_MOVE:
        Serial.println("Someone moving");
        Serial.println("---------------------------------");
        break;
      case HUMANPARA:
        Serial.print("The parameters of human body signs are: ");
        Serial.println(radar.bodysign_val, DEC);
        Serial.println("---------------------------------");
        break;
      case SOMEONE_CLOSE:
        Serial.println("Someone is closing");
        Serial.println("---------------------------------");
        break;
      case SOMEONE_AWAY:
        Serial.println("Someone is staying away");
        Serial.println("---------------------------------");
        break;
      case DETAILMESSAGE:
        Serial.print("Spatial static values: ");
        Serial.println(radar.static_val);
        Serial.print("Distance to stationary object: ");
        Serial.print(radar.dis_static);
        Serial.println(" m");

        Serial.print("Spatial dynamic values: ");
        Serial.println(radar.dynamic_val);

        Serial.print("Distance from the movement object: ");
        Serial.print(radar.dis_move);
        Serial.println(" m");
        
        Serial.print("Speed of moving object: ");
        Serial.print(radar.speed);
        Serial.println(" m/s");
        Serial.println("---------------------------------");
        break;
    }
  }
  delay(200);
}
```

To implement the data parsing function, we first need to call the `HumanStatic_func()` function. The parameter passed in can be `true` or `false` to control whether the display of the Human Movement Parameters is enabled or not.

If you choose to turn it on, i.e. pass in the parameter `true`, you may get the following message for the serial port.

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Radar_MR24HPCB1/2.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div>

:::note
Human Movement Parameters: human movement amplitude values. The Human Movement Parameters is **0** when no one is in the space, **1-5** when someone is present and stationary, and **2-100** when the body is in motion (the greater the motion amplitude the closer the body motion parameter is).
This means that if you feel that the results of the Sensor recognition do not meet your expectations, you can output information about the presence of the human body by customising the judgement of the Human Movement Parameters.
:::

If you want to stop the crazy output of the Human Movement Parameters on the serial port, enter the parameter `false` and you will then be able to see clean body status information on the serial port.

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Radar_MR24HPCB1/3.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div>

:::tip
You may not see content printed on the serial monitor for a longer period of time, this may be normal. The algorithm built into the Sensor is such that information is only output when the motion state of the monitored object changes. If you have been stationary after the upload procedure, you may wish to get up and move around and observe the effect.
:::

There is also the possibility that the data you received differs from the information in the data shown in the two images above. Then you may have switched on the Open Underlying Message output switch.

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Radar_MR24HPCB1/4.png"  style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div>

For more information on how to switch on and off Open Underlying Message, please refer to the relevant section of [**Demo3**](#jump1). In short, the opening of Open Underlying Message means that more detailed data is exported.

For the meaning of the data of the Open Underlying Message, please consult the [**Function**](#jump2) section or user manual of this Sensor for space reasons.

### <span id="jump1">Demo3: Send data to Sensor</span>

The MR24HPC1 offers a wealth of mode setting functions. This example will explain the implementation of the switch Open Underlying Message as an example of how to send data frames.

The following example program is in the examples folder of the library called **MR24HPCB1_open_underlyingMes**.

```c
#include "Arduino.h"
#include <humanstaticLite.h>

//#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
// Choose any two pins that can be used with SoftwareSerial to RX & TX
//#define RX_Pin A2
//#define TX_Pin A3

//SoftwareSerial mySerial = SoftwareSerial(RX_Pin, TX_Pin);

// we'll be using software serial
//HumanStaticLite radar = HumanStaticLite(&mySerial);

// can also try hardware serial with
HumanStaticLite radar = HumanStaticLite(&Serial1);

const unsigned char close_buff[10] = {0x53, 0x59, 0x08, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0xB5, 0x54, 0x43};  //switch off Open Underlying Message
const unsigned char open_buff[10] = {0x53, 0x59, 0x08, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x01, 0xB6, 0x54, 0x43};   //switch on Open Underlying Message

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial1.begin(115200);

  //  mySerial.begin(115200);

  while(!Serial);   //When the serial port is opened, the program starts to execute.

  Serial.println("Ready");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  radar.checkSetMode_func(open_buff, 10, false);
  delay(50);   //Do not set the delay time too long, as this may affect the reception of the data frames returned by the radar.
}
```

Before sending data to the Sensor, we need to consult the user manual to obtain the complete data frames to be sent according to our needs and define an array in the program to hold the data frames to be sent.

In this example, we have created two arrays of data frames according to the user manual. Their function is to turn on or off the Open Underlying Message function.

```c
const unsigned char close_buff[10] = {0x53, 0x59, 0x08, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0xB5, 0x54, 0x43};  //switch off Open Underlying Message
const unsigned char open_buff[10] = {0x53, 0x59, 0x08, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x01, 0xB6, 0x54, 0x43};   //switch on Open Underlying Message
```

:::tip
**Regarding the calculation of the check digit "sum".**

All data frames have a checksum bit to ensure that the data is sent or received accurately. The checksum bit is usually in the penultimate bit of the data frame. It is calculated by adding up all the bits preceding the check bit and taking the lower two bits in hexadecimal.
Let's take the example of a data frame that queries the device ID.
<div align="center"><img width ="{800}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Radar_MR24HPCB1/6.png"/></div>

It can be seen that the checksum bit is in the penultimate bit of the entire data frame. Then we start by adding all the previous hexadecimal numbers.

`0x53 + 0x59 + 0x02 + 0xA2 + 0x00 + 0x01 + 0x0F = 0x0160`

Then we need to take the lower two digits of it, which would be **60**, so the checksum of this data frame is **60**. If we want to look up the ID of the Sensor, then you can define the following array.

`const unsigned char DevID_buff[10] = {0x53, 0x59, 0x02, 0xA1, 0x00, 0x01, 0x0F, 0x60, 0x54, 0x43};`

:::

Then we send the data frame by calling the `checkSetMode_func()` function. The parameters passed in are an array of data frames, the length of the array and a boolean value for whether to send it cyclically.

```c
radar.checkSetMode_func(open_buff, 10, false);
```

Upload program. Opening your serial monitor to a baud rate of 115200 should show the result. The output should look something like the below image.

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Radar_MR24HPCB1/5.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div>

At this point please check the data frames returned and if they match the data frames returned as described in the user manual, then the setup was successful.

Normally, our commands do not need to be repeated to the Sensor, but as the Sensor replies with messages so fast that we cannot be sure that we will receive the exact data message returned by the Sensor. There are two solutions to this problem.

- Re-upload the above procedure several times.
- Set the third parameter of the `checkSetMode_func()` function (cyclic sending) to `true`. Please note, however, that repeatedly sending data frames of the setting type **may cause the Sensor to jam**, so please use this function with caution. If the Sensor is stuck, disconnect the 5V supply pin from the Sensor and wait a few moments for the function to resume.

### Demo4: Reset Sensor

There may be times when you have problems with your Sensor detecting anomalies or when you want to clear all settings on your Sensor, then you can reset your Sensor according to this example.

The following example program is in the examples folder of the library called **MR24HPCB1_reset_radar**.

```c
#include "Arduino.h"
#include <humanstaticLite.h>

//#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
// Choose any two pins that can be used with SoftwareSerial to RX & TX
//#define RX_Pin A2
//#define TX_Pin A3

//SoftwareSerial mySerial = SoftwareSerial(RX_Pin, TX_Pin);

// we'll be using software serial
//HumanStaticLite radar = HumanStaticLite(&mySerial);

// can also try hardware serial with
HumanStaticLite radar = HumanStaticLite(&Serial1);

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial1.begin(115200);

  //  mySerial.begin(115200);

  while(!Serial);   //When the serial port is opened, the program starts to execute.

  Serial.println("Ready");

  radar.reset_func();
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

Resetting the Sensor is very simple, you just need to call `reset_func()`. The reset only needs to be **executed once**, so we use it in the `Setup()` function.

### Demo5: Using Arduino/Seeeduino

Our library is Arduino compatible and you can also choose the Arduino you have on hand to develop your Sensor project.

The MR24HPC1 Sensor communicates using the UART serial port, you just need to connect the Sensor to your Arduino as wired below.

<table align="center">
  <tbody><tr>
      <td align="center">MR24HPC1</td>
      <td align="center" />
      <td align="center">MCU</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">5V</td>
      <td align="center">--&gt;</td>
      <td align="center">5V</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">GND</td>
      <td align="center">--&gt;</td>
      <td align="center">GND</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">RX</td>
      <td align="center">--&gt;</td>
      <td align="center">soft serial port TX</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">TX</td>
      <td align="center">--&gt;</td>
      <td align="center">soft serial port RX</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody></table>

All the functions are applied in the same way as in Demo1 to Demo4 above, so we will not repeat them in this example. In this example, we will give you an overview of how to use the Arduino's soft serial port to get data information from the Sensor.

:::tip
For notes on the Arduino soft serial port, please refer to the [official Arduino documentation](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/built-in-libraries/software-serial).
:::

To avoid data confusion caused by using Serial for both output and data transmission, on the Arduino side we usually use a soft serial port.

The import of the soft serial port library and the definition of the RX and TX pins need to be done earlier in the program. The following program defines the **A2** and **A3** pins as the **RX** and **TX** pins of the soft serial port.

```c
#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
//Choose any two pins that can be used with SoftwareSerial to RX & TX
#define RX_Pin A2
#define TX_Pin A3

SoftwareSerial mySerial = SoftwareSerial(RX_Pin, TX_Pin);

//we'll be using software serial
HumanStaticLite radar = HumanStaticLite(&mySerial);
```

Also, don't forget to set the baud rate for the soft serial port in the `Setup()` function.

```c
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(115200);

  mySerial.begin(115200);

  while(!Serial);   //When the serial port is opened, the program starts to execute.

  Serial.println("Ready");
}
```

Using **Demo1** as an example, if you want to use the Arduino to print the reported data frames from the Sensor, then the complete program is as follows.

```c
#include "Arduino.h"
#include <humanstaticLite.h>

#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
// Choose any two pins that can be used with SoftwareSerial to RX & TX
#define RX_Pin A2
#define TX_Pin A3

SoftwareSerial mySerial = SoftwareSerial(RX_Pin, TX_Pin);

// we'll be using software serial
HumanStaticLite radar = HumanStaticLite(&mySerial);

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(115200);

  mySerial.begin(115200);

  while(!Serial);   //When the serial port is opened, the program starts to execute.

  Serial.println("Ready");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  radar.recvRadarBytes();           //Receive radar data and start processing
  radar.showData();                 //Serial port prints a set of received data frames
  delay(200);                       //Add time delay to avoid program jam
}
```

### Demo6: Direct connection to PC for data

You can refer to this routine if you want to use an upper computer designed for Sensor, or if you want to use the serial software to get a complete data frame.

Connect the Sensor directly to the computer's usb port via a **UART to USB** device. The wiring is shown in the table below.

<table align="center">
  <tbody><tr>
      <td colSpan={4}><div align="center"><img width="{800}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Radar_MR24HPCB1/10.jpg" /></div></td>

      <td align="center">TX</td>
      <td align="center">--&gt;</td>
      <td align="center">RX</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody></table>

Use a software like serial debugging assistant to select the serial port where the Sensor is located.

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/37.png" style={{width:200, height:'auto'}}/></div>

:::caution
MR24HPC1 Sensor needs 5V power supply, otherwise the Sensor may not work properly.
:::

After a successful connection, you will see the Sensor sending a steady stream of messages.

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/39.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div>

At the same time, you can also send data frames to the Sensor via the software's send function.

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/40.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### Demo7: MR24HPBC1 & XIAO ESP32C3 & ESPHome & Home Assistant

We have created a tutorial for connecting to ESPHome and Home Assistant for this radar and the XIAO ESP32C3, if you are interested, you can refer to the tutorial here.

- [XIAO ESP32C3 accesses Home Assistant via ESPHome service](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao-esp32c3-esphome)

### Demo8: Using sensors in the XIAO ESP32C3

Due to the [special design](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO_ESP32C3_Pin_Multiplexing/#special-way---use-usb-serial-and-uart0uart1-at-the-same-time) of the XIAO ESP32C3 hardware serial port, you will need to use the following code in order to use the UART to send and receive data messages with the sensor.

```cpp
#include "Arduino.h"
#include <humanstaticLite.h>
#include <HardwareSerial.h>

//HardwareSerial MySerial(0); // If you want to use D6 and D7 as serial pins, uncomment this line and comment the following line instead.
HardwareSerial MySerial(1);   // Create a new HardwareSerial class

// can also try hardware serial with
HumanStaticLite radar = HumanStaticLite(&MySerial);

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(115200);

  /*
   * 4, 5 indicate GPIO4 and GPIO5, corresponding to pins D2 and D3. 
   * If you want to use the hardware UART pins of the XIAO ESP32C3 directly, you can change 4, 5 to -1, -1.
   * MySerial.begin(115200, SERIAL_8N1, -1, -1);
   * 
   * In addition to this you can also use the D9 (GPIO9) and D10 (GPIO10) pins as serial ports.
   * MySerial1.begin(115200, SERIAL_8N1, 9, 10);
   */
  MySerial.begin(115200, SERIAL_8N1, 4, 5);

  while(!Serial);   //When the serial port is opened, the program starts to execute.

  delay(500);

  Serial.println("Ready");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  radar.recvRadarBytes();           //Receive radar data and start processing
  radar.showData();                 //Serial port prints a set of received data frames
  delay(200);                       //Add time delay to avoid program jam
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### **FAQ1: Can this Sensor detect more than one person at a time in the same environment?**

> A: Not available. This Sensor can only be used on a single living object. If more than one person or animal is in the monitoring range, this will have an effect on the results of the monitoring.

### FAQ2: Why can't I see anything in the serial monitor with the XIAO ESP32C3?

> XIAO ESP32C3 serial port function is not quite consistent with the general Arduino hardware, and using Serial1 directly may cause the USB serial port not to work. For related application cases, please go to the [Serial chapter of XIAO ESP32C3](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO_ESP32C3_Pin_Multiplexing/#serial) for details.
