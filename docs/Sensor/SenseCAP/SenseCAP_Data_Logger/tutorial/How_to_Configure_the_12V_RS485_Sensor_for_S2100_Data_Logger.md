## Power supply options of sensor
Data Logger supports two power supply modes, we choose the External 12V DC mode here:

|**Mode**|**Description**|
| - | - |
|Built-in Battery|The Data Logger and sensors are powered by batteries. In this case, the Data Logger can be connected to a 5V sensor.|
|External 12V DC|<p>Supply power to Data Logger and sensor through external 12V power supply. When the external 12V is disconnected, the system switches to battery power. </p><p>When using external 12V power supply, use it together with the junction box to ensure the waterproof performance of the device.</p>|


## Connect to the junction box
Wire sequence of M12 cable:


<div align="center"><img width={400}src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-S2110/12V_RS485_Sensor/6.png"/></div>

When your sensor needs 12V power, the battery will not be able to drive the sensor. Therefore, an external 12V power supply is required.

1) Prepare the following items: 12V DC adapter, Junction box, and 8-pin wire(we only need 4 pins here).
2) Wire to the terminal of the Data Logger.

<div align="center"><img width={400}src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-S2110/12V_RS485_Sensor/7.png"/></div>

Connect the cover, rubber ring and screw cap in turn.

<div align="center"><img width={400}src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-S2110/12V_RS485_Sensor/8.png"/></div>
<div align="center"><img width={400}src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-S2110/12V_RS485_Sensor/9.png"/></div>

3) Wire to the terminal of the junction box.

<div align="center"><img width={400}src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-S2110/12V_RS485_Sensor/10.png"/></div>



4) Connect the M12 sensor wire to the junction box.


<div align="center"><img width={400}src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-S2110/12V_RS485_Sensor/11.png"/></div>

5) Connect the 12V DC adapter to the power supply.
## Connect to the Sensor
Now we'll move on to connecting the sensor after successfully connecting the transfer box to the S2100 in the previous process.
First, we need to learn about the wire sequence of ONE Compact Weather Station Sensor:

<div align="center"><img width={400}src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-S2110/12V_RS485_Sensor/12.png"/></div>

The device adopts an M12 8-pin connector, the different colored pins provide power and data communication (as shown in the above diagram).

When working with the RS-485, you can connect only 4 wires (not using a heating function), and the rest can be individually wrapped with tape to prevent short circuit.


<div align="center"><img width={400}src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-S2110/12V_RS485_Sensor/13.png"/></div>

The holes of the cable and the pins of the device connector **must be aligned** when the cable is plugged in.

<div align="center"><img width={400}src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-S2110/12V_RS485_Sensor/14.png"/></div>



Plugin the cable and tighten it clockwise

<div align="center"><img width={400}src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-S2110/12V_RS485_Sensor/15.png"/></div>


To complete the assembly.

<div align="center"><img width={400}src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-S2110/12V_RS485_Sensor/16.png"/></div>



**Tighten the screws and screw caps** **to check the waterproofing**. If the wire diameter is too thin, add waterproof tape for winding.

<div align="center"><img width={400}src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-S2110/12V_RS485_Sensor/17.png"/></div>



**\*Note:** When assembling the device, it is necessary to install the waterproof pad of the Data Logger and the adapter box, and tighten the screw cap and screw, otherwise the waterproof effect of the device may be affected!

If the wire diameter is too small, it can be wrapped with waterproof tape, as shown below:

<div align="center"><img width={400}src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-S2110/12V_RS485_Sensor/18.png"/></div>

 We've finished the wiring at this point. Now, let's set up the S2100 and configure it on our APP.
# Setup the S2100
## Connect to Sensor through App
1) Press button and hold for **3 seconds**, the LED will flash at 1s frequency. Please use the App to connect the sensor within 1 minute; otherwise, the device will power off or reboot.

<div align="center"><img width={400}src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-S2110/12V_RS485_Sensor/21.png"/></div>


3) Select the Sensor by S/N (S/N is on the front label of the sensor). Then, the basic information of the sensor will be displayed after entering.

<div align="center"><img width={400}src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-S2110/12V_RS485_Sensor/22.png"/></div>
<div align="center"><img width={400}src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-S2110/12V_RS485_Sensor/23.png"/></div>

4) Enter configuration mode after Bluetooth connection is successful: LED flashes at 2s frequency.


## Configure basic parameters through App
### Select the Platform and Frequency
S210x Sensors are manufactured to support universal frequency plan from 863MHz ~928MHz in one SKU. That is to say, every single device can support 7 frequency plans.

Here we select the “SenseCAP for Helium” or “SenseCAP for TTN”. The Frequency Plan is based on your actual situation.

**\*Note:** Data Logger can upload data when there is a Helium network around the user. It runs on SenseCAP private Helium Console. Users do not need to create a device on the Helium Console;

SenseCAP for TTN platform needs to be used with SenseCAP LoRaWAN outdoor gateway(https://www.seeedstudio.com/LoRaWAN-Gateway-EU868-p-4305.html)

<div align="center"><img width={400}src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-S2110/12V_RS485_Sensor/25.png"/></div>


### Set the Interval
The working mode of device: wake up the device every interval and collect measurement values and upload them through LoRa.  

For example, the device collects and uploads data **every 60 minutes by default**.

<div align="center"><img width={400}src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-S2110/12V_RS485_Sensor/26.png"/></div>



### Set the Packet Policy
The sensor uplink packet strategy has three modes, we select 1N here or you can according to your own requirement.

<div align="center"><img width={400}src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-S2110/12V_RS485_Sensor/27.png"/></div>

|**Parameter**|**Description**|
| - | - |
|2C+1N (default)|2C+1N (2 confirm packets and 1 none-confirm) is the best strategy, the mode can minimize the packet loss rate, however the device will consume the most data packet in TTN, or date credits in Helium network.|
|1C|1C (1 confirm) the device will sleep after get 1 received confirm packet from server.|
|1N|1N (1 none-confirm) the device only send packet and then start to sleep, no matter the server received the data or not.|


### Restore Factory Setting
When selecting the SenseCAP platform, you must use the fixed EUI/App EUI/App Key. Therefore, you need to restore the factory Settings before switching back to the SenseCAP platform from other platforms.

<div align="center"><img width={400}src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-S2110/12V_RS485_Sensor/28.png"/></div>


When we make a mistake or want to reset everything, we can click the button. The device will be restored to the factory's default configuration.

**\*Note:** The “Restore Factory” function can only reset the Basic Setting.
