The Grove-RJ45 Adapter is a module which can convert a standard Grove connector to a RJ45 connector. Universal 4-Pin Grove cables can not meet the requirements when Arduino remote connect and control Grove module. Through two  RJ45 adapter and a cable, It is able to achieve communication between Arduino and Grove module. This help solve the problem that Arduino and Grove are not convenient to connect because of the distance issue.
