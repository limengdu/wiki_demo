# Seeed Light Sensor Selection Guide

Here at Seeed, we have released different Light Sensors and this may cause problems for some of you where you don't know which one to pick and which one is suitable for your needs. Here comes the solution! Please check the comparison in this site for more reference.

For all the Light sensors in our bazaar, please click [Bazaar Light tag](https://www.seeedstudio.com/tag/light.html) to check.

## What is Light Sensor

A light sensor is a photoelectric device that converts light energy (photons) detected to electrical energy (electrons). Seems simple? There is more to a light sensor then just its definition. It comes in different types, used in various applications and more!

### Glossary of terms

Before we start with today’s’ light sensor guide, we’ll have to understand the following terms that are commonly associated with light. I’ve simplified it for easier understanding:

### Candela

- Originated from the term candles, candela refers to luminous intensity; how strong is the light to a naked eye
  
- The higher the luminous intensity, the higher the sensitivity it is to our eyes

### Lumen

- Measures the total amount of visible light from a light source through the relationship between luminous intensity and the angle that a light beam fills
- Commonly used to rate the brightness of a light bulb
- To simply put it Lumen = Total amount of light emitted in all directions

### Lux

- Used to measure illuminance, the area where the luminous flux is spread
- It’s similar to Lumen but it takes into account the surface area
- To simply put it, Lux = total amount of light that falls on a particular surface

:::note
If you’re still confused between Lumen and Lux, here’s a graphical representation:

### What are the types of light sensor

There are different types of light sensors available; mainly Photoresistor, Photodiodes, and Phototransistors. Sounds technical? I’ll break it down with the explanations below!

**1. Photoresistors (LDR)**

<div align="center"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Photoresistors_-_three_sizes_-_mm_scale.jpg"/></div>

The most common light sensor type that’s used in a light sensor circuit are photoresistors, also known as a light-dependent resistor (LDR). Photoresistors are used to simply detect whether a light is on or off and compare relative light levels throughout a day.

**What are photoresistors made of?**

- A high resistance Semiconductor material called cadmium sulfide cells, highly sensitive to visible and near-infrared light

**How photoresistors work?**

<div align="center"><img src="https://www.edgefx.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Light-Intensity-vs-LDR-Resistance.jpg"/></div>

As its name suggests, photoresistors work similarly to your regular resistors, but instead resistance change is dependent on the amount of light it’s exposed to.

- High intensity of light causes a lower resistance between the cadmium sulfide cell
- The low intensity of light results in a higher resistance between the cadmium sulfide cells

This working principle can be seen in applications such as street lamps, wherein the day, the higher light intensity results in lower resistance and no light produced.

**2. Photodiodes**

<div align="center"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Fotodio.jpg/220px-Fotodio.jpg"/></div>

Photodiodes are another type of light sensor. But instead of using the change in resistance like LDR, it’s more complex to light, easily changing light into a flow of electric currents.

Also known as a photodetector, photo sensor.

**What are photodiodes made of?**

- Photodiodes are mainly made from silicon and germanium materials and comprise of optical filters, built-in lenses and surface areas

**How photodiodes work?**

Photodiodes work on the working principle called the inner photoelectric effect. To simply put it, when a beam of light hits, electrons are loosened, causing electron-holes which results in electrical current to flow through.

- The brighter the light present, the stronger the electrical current will be.

**Photodiode light sensor applications**

Since current generated by photodiodes are directly proportional to the intensity of light, it makes it favorable for light sensing that requires fast light response changes.

Since photodiodes are responsive to infrared light, it’s applicable for more usages as well.

Here are some of the applications of photodiode:

- Consumer electronics ranging from compact disc players to smoke detectors and even remote control devices
- Medical applications such as equipment/instruments used for measuring and analysis purposes
- Solar energy systems such as solar panels

**3. Phototransistors**

The last light sensor type we’ll be exploring today is the phototransistor. The phototransistor light sensor can be described as a photodiode + amplifier. With the added amplification, light sensitivity is far better on the phototransistors.

However, it doesn’t fair better in low light level detection as compared to photodiodes.
Since both light sensor types share a similar working principle, do refer to the previous explanation!
