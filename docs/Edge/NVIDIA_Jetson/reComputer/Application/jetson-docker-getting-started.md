Last week, I was lucky enough to get access to the latest Seeed Studio [reComputer J1020](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Jetson-10-1-H0-p-5335.html) edge AI device for the first time. The reComputer J1020 is powered by Jetson Nano development kit. It is a small, hand-sized powerful computer that brings the power of modern AI for embedded developers. This $259 small device  is built around the NVIDIA Jetson Nano system-on-module and designed for Edge AI applications. This device lets you run multiple neural networks in parallel for applications like image classification, object detection, segmentation, and speech processing. With rich extension modules, industrial peripherals, and thermal management, reComputer J1020 is ready to help you accelerate and scale the next-gen AI product by deploying popular DNN models and ML frameworks to the edge and inferencing with high performance, for tasks like real-time classification and object detection, pose estimation, semantic segmentation, and natural language processing (NLP).

## Running Docker on reComputer Jetson Nano

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/jetson-docker/4.png" /></div>

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a suite of software development tools for creating, sharing and running individual containers. It is a containerization platform that packages your application and all its dependencies together in the form of a docker container to ensure that your application works seamlessly in any environment. Docker Container is a standardized unit which can be created on the fly to deploy a particular application or environment.

Developing any kind of application today is complex. It’s  much more than writing code. There are multitude of programming languages, web frameworks,  complex architectures, and discontinuous interfaces between tools for each lifecycle stage and that creates enormous complexity. Docker simplifies and accelerates your workflow, while giving developers the freedom to innovate with their choice of tools, application stacks, and deployment environments for each project. It enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.

Docker is officially supported on reComputer J1020, a Jetson Nano powered development kit. The kit comes with the latest version of Docker pre-installed by default. You can verify the version of Docker by running the following command:

```sh
sudo docker version

```

## Installing Docker Compose

reComputer Jetson doesn’t come with Docker compose installed. You can follow the below steps to install Docker Compose in your system:

```sh
export DOCKER_COMPOSE_VERSION=2.6.0
sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
sudo pip3 install docker-compose=="${DOCKER_COMPOSE_VERSION}"
apt install python3
apt install python3-pip
pip install docker-compose
```

## Install the latest version of CUDA toolkit

```sh
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1804/sbsa/cuda-ubuntu1804.pin
sudo mv cuda-ubuntu1804.pin /etc/apt/preferences.d/cuda-repository-pin-600
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/11.3.1/local_installers/cuda-repo-ubuntu1804-11-3-local_11.3.1-465.19.01-1_arm64.deb
sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1804-11-3-local_11.3.1-465.19.01-1_arm64.deb
sudo apt-key add /var/cuda-repo-ubuntu1804-11-3-local/7fa2af80.pub
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install cuda
```

## Verify Docker runtime

```sh
docker info | grep runtime

 Runtimes: nvidia runc io.containerd.runc.v2 io.containerd.runtime.v1.linuxs
```

## Running Your first Python Container

Let us test drive a simple Arm-based Python Docker image by running the below command:

```sh
sudo docker run arm64v8/python:slim ls
```

## Monitoring CPU, GPU and Memory using JTOP Docker container

In this section, you will see how to set up a system monitoring utility to monitor CPU, RAM and GPU. We will be using the JTOP utility. Jtop is a system monitoring utility that runs on the terminal and sees and controls real time the status of your reComputer Jetson Nano kit, CPU, RAM, GPU status and frequency. You will see how you can containerise the utility. Let’s get started –

First, create a Dockerfile with the following content:

```sh
FROM python:3-alpine

RUN apk update \

    && apk --no-cache add bash \

    && pip install jetson-stats \

    && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*
```

The first line shows that we have picked up python:3-alpine as a base image. The second line install jetson-stats and dependent packages

## Building the JTOP Docker Image

Use docker build CLI to build the Docker image

```sh
docker build -t ajeetraina/jetson-stats-nano .
```

## Running the JTOP Docker Container

It’s time to run the Docker container by passing –gpus as a parameter and mounting it to jtop socket.

```sh
docker run --rm -it --gpus all -v /run/jtop.sock:/run/jtop.sock ajeetraina/jetson-stats-nano jtop
```

You will see the following results:
