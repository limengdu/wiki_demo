# reComputer for Jetson Memory Expansion

The reComputer for Jetson is sold with 16 GB of eMMC and has **ubuntu 18.04 LTS** and **NVIDIA JetPack 4.6** installed, so the remaining user space available is about 2 GB, which is a significant obstacle to using the reComputer for training and deployment in some projects. This tutorial will introduce the expansion process for different models of reComputer based on this situation, and help developers to expand their systems by transferring them to external storage devices.

## Fundamentals Of Capacity Expansion

The first sector on the disk where the system is installed is called the **Master Boot Record (MBR)**, which contains information about the **BootLoader**, the partition table, and the fixed identifier **55AA**. During the boot process of Linux, the **BootLoader** and the **kernel** go through two important phases.

**Phase 1:** The BootLoader initializes **(initrd)** a temporary root file system **(ramfs)**. The ramfs contains configuration programs for drivers, file systems (fs), networks (net), etc. that are necessary at boot time. After that, control of the BootLoader is transferred to the kernel so that the kernel can take out these programs, move them to memory **(RAM)** and run them to load the various functional modules.

**Phase 2:** After the kernel has loaded the necessary modules with the ramfs, it releases the system and configures the real root file system **(rootfs)** to mount to the real root directory.

1. In the above two phases, we do not need to modify the part of the kernel that loads the functional modules with the ramfs (phase 1), so even if reComputer has been expanded, it will still need to use eMMC.
2. What we need to modify is the second phase, which mounts the root filesystem to external memory, thus enabling the expansion.

## Notes On Capacity Expansion

1. The main principle of scaling via external storage is to set the rootfs to be on an external storage device.

2. This expansion method will modify the Linux kernel level system files and you may encounter some problems that are not easy to solve. You should use a new reComputer and a new storage device when following this tutorial to complete the expansion, and **do not try to store valuable files on the device**. If everything does not work as expected, you may need to reformat the storage device or even the reComputer, and for the final retention option, we will offer to help you restore the backup via the serial port if possible, but you are responsible for any data loss.

3. This expansion process does not require recompiling the kernel and saves about 40 minutes of installation time compared to other earlier expansion methods available online.

## Expansion Via M.2 Slot On Carrier Board And SSD

SSD, also known as Solid State Drives, is often used as the primary storage device for laptops, desktops, etc. With its high reliability and fast data read and write rates, it is the best choice for reComputer expansion. The following table lists the reComputer Series products that are currently available for SSD expansion solutions. The main reason why the reComputer J1010 does not support SSD expansion is because the carrier board is not equipped with a suitable M.2 slot.

### Software And Hardware Requirements

The following conditions need to be met for the expansion solution using SSDs, which are the basic requirements for the expansion to be proven to be successful.

  </tbody>
</table>


!!!Attention
    The updated JetPack version has not been tested for expansion, so the stability or success of the expansion cannot be guaranteed, please follow this tutorial carefully.

    The SSD needs to be M.2 M-Key, otherwise it will not match the interface on the carrier board.
    <div align=center><img width = 300 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/recomputer-Jetson-20-1-H1/kuorong/3.jpeg"/></div>

    Storage devices with non-extended fourth generation file systems (Ext4) cannot complete expansion operations.

### Expansion steps

**Step 1.** Install the SSD

Follow the steps in the [Hardware Instructions](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/reComputer_Jetson_Series_Hardware_Layout/) to install the SSD for reComputer.

**Step 2.** Prepare SSD

Use the shortcut `Ctrl+F` or click the Ubuntu icon in the upper left corner to search for **Disks** and open the Disks tool that comes with Ubuntu 18.04.

<div align="center"><img width={500} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/recomputer-Jetson-20-1-H1/kuorong/1.png" /></div>

Select your SSD on the left side and then select **Format Disk** in the upper right corner under the menu bar.

<div align="center"><img width={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/recomputer-Jetson-20-1-H1/kuorong/ssd1.jpg" /></div>


Format your SSD to GPT format. A pop-up window will appear asking you to confirm and enter your user password.

<div align="center"><img width={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/recomputer-Jetson-20-1-H1/kuorong/ssd3.png" /></div>


Then, we click on the middle **+** to add a disk character.

<div align="center"><img width={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/recomputer-Jetson-20-1-H1/kuorong/ssd6.png" /></div>


Click on "Next".

<div align="center"><img width={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/recomputer-Jetson-20-1-H1/kuorong/ssd7.png" /></div>


Please give your SSD a name and select **Ext4** in the type and click "Create". At this point we have completed the SSD prep according to the expansion requirements.

<div align="center"><img width={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/recomputer-Jetson-20-1-H1/kuorong/ssd8.png" /></div>


**Step 3.** Build the root directory to the SSD

Use the git command to download the script files we need to use to reComputer.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/limengdu/rootOnNVMe.git
$ cd rootOnNVMe/
```

Then execute the following command to build the files from the root directory in the eMMC to the SSD, the wait time for this step depends on the size of the root directory you are using.

```sh
$ ./copy-rootfs-ssd.sh
```

**Step 4.** Configure the environment and complete the expansion

Execute the following command to complete the configuration of rootfs.

```sh
$ ./setup-service.sh
```

<div align="center"><img width={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/recomputer-Jetson-20-1-H1/kuorong/9.png" /></div>

When you restart reComputer, you will see that the eMMC has become an external storage device on the main interface, and you will see that the system footprint has been reduced, so the expansion was successful.

<div align="center"><img width={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/recomputer-Jetson-20-1-H1/kuorong/11.png" /></div>

!!!Attention
    The default SSD path in the script file is `/dev/nvme0n1p1`, which is also the path assigned by default by reComputer. If you find that your SSD path does not match this with the command `sudo fdisk -l`, change the path of all `/dev/nvme0n1p1` in the files **copy-rootfs-ssd.sh**, **data/setssdroot.service**, and **data/setssdroot.sh** in rootOnNVMe to the path where your SSD is located.
   <div align="center"><img width={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/recomputer-Jetson-20-1-H1/kuorong/21.png" /></div>


    The above expansion will not remove the original root directory contents from the eMMC. If you do not want to boot from the SSD, you can remove the SSD and the system will still boot from the eMMC.

## Capacity expansion via USB storage device

USB storage devices, such as USB flash drives and mobile hard drives, are widely used as external storage in various areas of life, and USB expansion is also applicable to reComputer. The following table lists the reComputer products that are currently available for USB expansion solutions.

<table align="center">
  <tbody><tr>
      <th align="center">Product</th>
      <th align="center">reComputer J1010</th>  
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th align="center">SKU
      </th><td align="center">110061362</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th align="center">Side View
      </th><td align="center"><div align="center"><img width={300} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/recomputer-Jetson-20-1-H1/frontview3_1.png" /></div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th align="center">Equipped Module
      </th><td align="center">Jetson Nano 4G</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th align="center">Operating carrier Board
      </th><td align="center">J1010 carrier board</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


The biggest advantage of scaling via USB storage devices over scaling via SSDs is the high degree of convenience of USB devices and the simplicity of removing them.
However, even with the high-speed USB 3.2 interface, the data transfer rate is far less than that of the standard PCIe bus, so the SSD expansion method is superior in terms of stability, reliability and data transfer speed.

### Software And Hardware Requirements

The following conditions need to be met for the expansion solution using USB, which is the basic requirement to verify that the expansion can be done successfully.

<table align="center">
  <tbody><tr>
      <th align="center"> </th>
      <th align="center">software and hardware requirements</th>  
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th align="center">reComputer for Jetson
      </th><td align="left">JetPack versions 4.4 ~ 4.6 <br />

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th align="center">USB storage devices
      </th><td align="left">USB storage devices need to be fourth generation extended file system (Ext4) <br />
        USB storage device power supply current â‰¤ 0.5 A</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


!!!Attention
    The updated JetPack version has not been tested for expansion, so the stability or success of the expansion cannot be guaranteed, please follow this tutorial carefully.

    Large-capacity USB storage devices require that the reComputer be powered properly to maintain proper operation, and USB storage devices with capacities above 512 GB are not recommended. Insufficient power supply may cause reComputer to power down.

    Equipped Module other than Jetson Nano do not support expansion using this method at this time.

    Storage devices with non-extended fourth generation file systems (Ext4) cannot complete expansion operations.

### Expansion steps

**Step 1.** Prepare the necessary documents

Use the git command to download the script files we need to use to reComputer.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/limengdu/bootFromUSB.git
$ cd bootFromUSB
```

**Step 2.** Preparing the USB storage device

Connect a USB storage device to reComputer and open the Disks tool that comes with Ubuntu 18.04 by using the shortcut `Ctrl+F` or by clicking the Ubuntu icon in the upper left corner and searching for **Disks**.

<div align="center"><img width={500} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/recomputer-Jetson-20-1-H1/kuorong/1.png" /></div>

Select your USB storage device on the left side and then select **Format Disk** in the upper right corner under the menu bar.

<div align="center"><img width={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/recomputer-Jetson-20-1-H1/kuorong/sd1.jpg" /></div>


Format your USB storage device to GPT format. A pop-up window will appear asking you to confirm and enter your user password.

<div align="center"><img width={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/recomputer-Jetson-20-1-H1/kuorong/sd2.png" /></div>


Then, we click on the middle **+** to add a disk character.

<div align="center"><img width={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/recomputer-Jetson-20-1-H1/kuorong/sd4.png" /></div>


Click on "Next".

<div align="center"><img width={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/recomputer-Jetson-20-1-H1/kuorong/sd5.png" /></div>


Please give your USB storage device a name and select **Ext4** in the type and click "Create". At this point we have completed the USB storage device prep according to the expansion requirements.

<div align="center"><img width={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/recomputer-Jetson-20-1-H1/kuorong/sd6.png" /></div>


**Step 3.** Mounting a USB storage device

The USB storage device prepared according to **step 2** can be seen in the Disks software as unmounted.

!!!Note
	If you find that your USB device has been automatically mounted after formatting, skip this step.

<div align="center"><img width={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/recomputer-Jetson-20-1-H1/kuorong/60.png" /></div>


We use the following command to mount the USB device.

```sh
$ mkdir /media/USB/
$ sudo mount <USB Device Path> /media/USB/
```

Where `<USB Device Path>` refers to the path of the USB storage device, this parameter can be seen in Device of the Disks software or can be queried with the command `sudo fdisk -l`. For example, for my USB device, I can mount `/dev/sda1` to `/media/USB/` with the following command.

```sh
$ sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/USB/
```

Use the following command to check the mount location of the device.

```sh
$ sudo findmnt -rno TARGET <USB Device Path>
```

For my USB device, the commands I need to use are:

```sh
$ sudo findmnt -rno TARGET /dev/sda1
```


**Step 4.** Copy the system to a USB storage device

The **copyRootToUSB.sh** script copies the contents of the entire eMMC system to the USB storage device. Of course, the USB storage device should have more storage space than the eMMC.

The command used is as follows.

```sh
usage: ./copyRootToUSB.sh [OPTIONS]
-d | --directory     Directory path to parent of kernel

-v | --volume_label  Label of Volume to lookup

-p | --path          Device Path to USB drive (e.g. /dev/sda1)

-h | --help  This message
```

In general, for regular expansion needs, we can just select `-p` in the parameter `[OPTIONS]` and later we need to add the path of the USB device (e.g. `/dev/sda1`), which we got in **step 3**. For example, for my USB device, the full command I need to use is:

```sh
$ ./copyRootToUSB.sh -p /dev/sda1
```

The length of time this command takes to execute depends on the size of the files stored on your eMMC.

**Step 5.** Querying the UUID of USB devices

Just to be sure, we need to look up the UUID of the USB device.

```sh
$ ./partUUID.sh 
```

The default path for this command is **sda1 (/dev/sda1)**, but you can also determine the UUID of other USB devices. specify `/dev/ using` the `-d` flag. For example, for my USB device it would be:

```sh
$ ./partUUID.sh -d sdb1

UUID of Disk: /dev/sdb1
e34d67bb-83bb-4fc5-b9a4-a1388d2b2be5
Sample for /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf entry:
APPEND ${cbootargs} root=UUID=e34d67bb-83bb-4fc5-b9a4-a1388d2b2be5 rootwait rootfstype=ext4
```

!!!Attention
    If the returned UUID differs in format and length from the example above, then the device is probably not formatted as Ext4, start over from **step 2**!

**Step 6.** Modify the boot configuration to complete the expansion

We need to make a backup of the boot configuration file first.

```sh
$ sudo cp /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf.bak
```

This step is the most important and dangerous step in the USB device expansion operation. Edit the `/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf` file and `/media/nvidia/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf`, then add an entry to point to the new rootfs, the location is the path of the USB device, fill it in the parameter `<path>` below. The path information is obtained in **step 3**.

```sh
$ sudo vi /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf
$ sudo vi /media/nvidia/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf

LABEL primary
      MENU LABEL primary kernel
      LINUX /boot/Image
      INITRD /boot/initrd
      APPEND ${cbootargs} quiet root=<path> rw rootwait rootfstype=ext4 console=ttyS0,115200n8 console=tty0 fbcon=map:0 net.ifnames=0 sdhci_tegra.en_boot_part_access=1
```

For the USB storage device I am using, the modified `/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf` file and `/media/nvidia/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf` reads as follows:

```sh
TIMEOUT 30
DEFAULT primary

MENU TITLE L4T boot options

LABEL primary
      MENU LABEL primary kernel
      LINUX /boot/Image
      INITRD /boot/initrd
      APPEND ${cbootargs} quiet root=/dev/sda1 rw rootwait rootfstype=ext4 console=ttyS0,115200n8 console=tty0 fbcon=map:0 net.ifnames=0 sdhci_tegra.en_boot_part_access=1
#      APPEND ${cbootargs} quiet root=/dev/mmcblk0p1 rw rootwait rootfstype=ext4 console=ttyS0,115200n8 console=tty0 fbcon=map:0 net.ifnames=0 sdhci_tegra.en_boot_part_access=1 

# When testing a custom kernel, it is recommended that you create a backup of
# the original kernel and add a new entry to this file so that the device can
# fallback to the original kernel. To do this:
#
# 1, Make a backup of the original kernel
#      sudo cp /boot/Image /boot/Image.backup
#
# 2, Copy your custom kernel into /boot/Image
#
# 3, Uncomment below menu setting lines for the original kernel
#
# 4, Reboot

# LABEL backup
#    MENU LABEL backup kernel
#    LINUX /boot/Image.backup
#    INITRD /boot/initrd
#    APPEND ${cbootargs}
```

Save the file and restart reComputer, the system root will switch to the USB storage device and the expansion is complete.

<div align="center"><img width={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/recomputer-Jetson-20-1-H1/kuorong/62.png" /></div>


## Restore System Backup Via Serial Console

When your system does not boot properly due to an error, or for some other reason (a common scenario is that the Nvidia icon keeps recurring on boot), then the backup you made during the expansion will play an important role. We understand your anxiety at this moment, but please be patient and follow the steps below to get reComputer into the serial console and we will operate the U-boot to restore your backup.

### Steps to access the serial console

**Step 1.** Connecting the UART to USB module to the reComputer

Connect the reComputer to the UART to USB module according to the wiring instructions in the table below.

<table align="center">
  <tbody><tr>
      <td colSpan={3}><div align="center"><img width={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/recomputer-Jetson-20-1-H1/kuorong/8.jpeg" /></div></td>

      <td align="center">UART RXD</td>
      <td align="center">--&gt;</td>
      <td align="center">TX</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


!!!Tip
    The VCC interface between the reComputer and the UART to USB module does not need to be connected.

    The reComputer does not need to be powered on for the time being after the cable is connected, so please set it aside for now.

    Please disconnect the expanded external memory.

**Step 2.** Install and start minicom on the Ubuntu host

If your Ubuntu host does not have minicom installed, you can install minicom on your computer with the following command.

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install minicom
```

After waiting for the installation to complete, enter the command to start minicom.

```sh
$ sudo minicom
```

<div align="center"><img width={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/recomputer-Jetson-20-1-H1/kuorong/40.png" /></div>

**Step 3.** Preparing to configure minicom

In the minicom menu bar, we open the serial port and configure it so that we can get the reComputer startup information through minicom. In the menu bar, press the keyboard **o** key to access the configuration screen. Use the keyboard up and down arrow keys to control the cursor to move to **Serial port setup**.

<div align="center"><img width={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/recomputer-Jetson-20-1-H1/kuorong/41.png" /></div>

**Step 4.** Connecting reComputer to the Ubuntu host

At this moment, we create a new command line window and enter commands in the window to monitor the access of the new device.

```sh
$ dmesg --follow
```

At this point we will power up the reComputer and connect the UART to USB module with the reComputer connected to the Ubuntu host via the USB port. The command line window will show the name of the newly connected device, we need to find the fragment starting with **tty** and write it down.

<div align="center"><img width={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/recomputer-Jetson-20-1-H1/kuorong/44.png" /></div>

**Step 5.** U-boot operation

Go back to minicom and fill in the device name obtained in **step 4** into **Serial Device**. Also, check whether the baud rate is configured to **115200**.

Re-enter the command `sudo minicom` and after entering minicom, we will see the reComputer startup information in the window.

We can troubleshoot why reComputer fails to boot by using the information returned and by using the command help to see all the commands available under the U-boot system. Knowing how to use these commands is necessary to solve the problem, but of course it can be difficult.
