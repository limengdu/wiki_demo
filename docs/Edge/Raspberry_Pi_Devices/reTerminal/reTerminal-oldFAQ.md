# FAQs for reTerminal Usage

This document contains all the frequently asked questions related to reTerminal. This will be very helpful if you are suffering from any issues when using the reTerminal.

## Q1: How can I update the STM32 firmware for reTerminal LCD

**Note:** If your reTerminal is manufactured after 26/09/2021, the STM32 comes with V1.8 firmware pre-installed.

It is very important to make sure that you have the latest firmware flashed on to the STM32G030 chip on the reTerminal. STM32G030 is responsible to drive the LCD on the reTerminal. Updating the STM32 chip to the latest version will be helpful to solve most of the issues that you face with the reTerminal LCD.

There are 2 methods of flashing the STM32 chip.

- **Method 1:** Directly connect to STM32 chip using the CM4 on the reTerminal and flash the firmware
- **Method 2:** Physically connect the STM32 chip pins to the 40-Pin reTerminal GPIO using jumper wires and then use OpenOCD to flash the firmware

**Method 1** works if you have the **new version (v1.7 or higher)** of the STM32 firmware on the reTerminal and on the other hand, **method 2** is only needed if you have the **old version (lower than v1.7)** of the STM32 firmware on the board.

### Decide Which Flashing Method to Use

Now let's go through the following steps to identify which version of the board we have so that we can choose the appropriate flashing method.

- **Step 1.** Enter terminal window of reTerminal and type the following to open the configuration file

```sh
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```

- **Step 2.** At the very bottom of this file, comment out the line which says **dtoverlay=reTerminal**

```sh
#dtoverlay=reTerminal
```

**Note:** This will unload all the reTerminal drivers. So when you turn on the reTerminal next time, none of the drivers will be loaded.

- **Step 3.** Reboot reTerminal

```sh
sudo reboot
```

- **Step 4.** Make STM32 enter **boot mode** through **i2c-tools**

```sh
i2ctransfer -y 1 w2@0x45 0x9b 0x01
```

- **Step 5.** List the connected I2C devices

```sh
i2cdetect -y 1
```

If you can see the I2C address **0x56** as the table below, you have the **new version (v1.7 or higher)** of the STM32 firmware on the board.

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="http://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/ReTerminal/i2c-new-board.png" alt="pir" width={600} height="auto" /></p>

However, if you can see the I2C address **0x45** as the table below, you have the **old version (lower than v1.7)** of the STM32 firmware on the board

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="http://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/ReTerminal/i2c-old-board.png" alt="pir" width={600} height="auto" /></p>

- **Step 6.** Open the configuration file that we used before

```sh
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```

- **Step 7.** At the very bottom of this file, uncomment the line which says **dtoverlay=reTerminal** to load the drivers again

```sh
dtoverlay=reTerminal
```

- **Step 8.** Power off reTerminal

```sh
sudo poweroff
```

**Note:** If you are already running **STM32 v1.8 firmware**, once you enter **boot mode** through **i2c-tools**, the only way to come out of boot mode is to flash the STM32 firmware.

## Q8: Why there is black glue around the chips on the CM4?

We have specially applied **epoxy resin underfill adhesive** (which looks like black glue) around the chips on the CM4 to make sure the ICs are protected well. This also makes the whole CM4 more reliable.

## Q9: Why does buzzer, LEDs and buttons do not work after installing the reTerminal drivers?

reTerminal comes equipped with 2 versions for the I/O Expansion chip. Old version with MCP23008 and new version with PCA9554. If you [installed reTerminal drivers manually](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/reTerminal/#install-reterminal-drivers-after-flashing-new-raspberry-pi-os-ubuntu-os-or-other-os), please check the following.

First of all check whether which chip is installed on your reTerminal.

- Open terminal window
- i2cdetect -y 1

If you see 0x20 I2C address, the reTerminal is equipped with MCP23008 chip

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/ReTerminal/IO-extend/0x20.png" alt="pir" width={500} height="auto" /></p>

If you see 0x38 I2C address, the reTerminal is equipped with PCA9554 chip

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/ReTerminal/IO-extend/0x38.jpg" alt="pir" width={500} height="auto" /></p>

For reTerminal with MCP23008 chip, you need to do the following.

- sudo nano /boot/config.txt
- Add "dtoverlay=reTerminal,addr=0x20,mcp23008" at the end of the file
- Ctrl + x > y > ENTER, to save and close the file
- sudo reboot

For the reTerminal with the latest PCA9554 chip, you don't have to do any changes.

## Q10: How can I install Ubuntu on reTerminal?

## Q11: The screen orientation is incorrect after installing Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye

- **Step 1.** After flashing **Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye** to reTerminal eMMC, follow [this guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/reTerminal/#install-reterminal-drivers-after-flashing-new-raspberry-pi-os-ubuntu-os-or-other-os) to install the necessary drivers

- **Step 2.** Create a new file named **monitors.xml** under **.config** directory

```sh
sudo vi ~/.config/monitors.xml
```

- **Step 3.** Copy the following content into the above file to explicitly set the LCD display (DSI-1) and save the file by typing **:wq** after pressing **ESC**

```sh
<monitors version="2">
  <configuration>
    <logicalmonitor>
      <x>0</x>
      <y>0</y>
      <primary>yes</primary>
      <monitor>
        <monitorspec>
          <connector>DSI-1</connector>
          <vendor>unknown</vendor>
          <product>unknown</product>
          <serial>unknown</serial>
        </monitorspec>
        <mode>
          <width>720</width>
          <height>1280</height>
          <rate>60.000</rate>
        </mode>
      </monitor>
      <transform>
        <rotation>right</rotation>
      </transform>
    </logicalmonitor>
  </configuration>
</monitors>
```

- **Step 4.** Open **/boot/config.txt**

```sh
sudo vi /boot/config.txt
```

- **Step 5.** Add the following into the file

```sh
dtoverlay=reTerminal,tp_rotate=1
```

- **Step 6.** Reboot reTerminal

```sh
sudo reboot
```

Now the screen will be displayed in the correct orientation!

## Q12: Troubleshooting Touch Screen Inaccuracy

After configuring the screen to the correct orientation, the touch position may still be inaccurate, causing the cursor to move in unexpected directions when you touch a specific area on the display. To address this issue, it is essential to take the following steps.

- **Step 1** : Open the terminal and enter to xorg.conf.d folder by typing

```sh
cd /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d
```

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/ReTerminal/FAQ/lcd_touch2.png" alt="pir" width={1000} height="auto" /></p>

- **Step 2** : You will have access to the "40-libinput.conf" file, which can be edited by using the command.

```sh
sudo nano 40-libinput.conf
```

- **Step 3**: Find the InputClass section of **touchscreen** InputClass.

- **Step 4**: Add following phrase. You can refer the screenshot

```sh
Option "TransformationMatrix" "0 1 0 -1 0 1 0 0 1
```

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/ReTerminal/FAQ/lcd_touch1.png" alt="pir" width={1000} height="auto" /></p>

- **Step 5** : Save by Ctrl+O and press enter then Ctrl+X  after that Reboot

```sh
Sudo reboot 
```

After rebooting, you may notice that the touch position is now accurate. This means that when you touch a specific area on the display, the cursor moves in the intended direction.

## Q13: LEDs and Buzzer do not work after installing reTerminal drivers

This issue will not last long. We will completely solve this issue later from reTerminal drivers itself

- **Step 1.** Open **/boot/config.txt**

```sh
sudo vi /boot/config.txt
```

- **Step 2.** Comment the following line and save the file by typing **:wq** after pressing **ESC**

```sh
#dtoverlay=reTerminal-bridge
```

- **Step 3.** Reboot reTerminal

```sh
sudo reboot
```

Now the LEDs and Buzzer will work as normal.

## Q14: How to check if the Encryption Chip is ATECC608A-SSHDA-B or ATECC608A-TNGTLSS-G

| Released Date | Encryption Chip IC Version |
|---|---|
| Before 09/03/2021 | ATECC608A-SSHDA-B |
| Sept 2021 - January 2022 | ATECC608A-SSHDA-B or ATECC608A-TNGTLSS-G |
| After 02/01/2022 | ATECC608A-TNGTLSS-G |

 To check which Encryption chip by type  ```i2cdetect -y 3``` command in Terminal, If you see ```0x35``` in the output table then the reTerminal is equipped with ATECC608A-TNGTLSS-G chip, otherwise it is equipped with ATECC608A-SSHDA-B.
