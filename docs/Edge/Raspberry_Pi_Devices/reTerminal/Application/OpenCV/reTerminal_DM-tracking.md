##  An Introduction

Object tracking is the process of consistently locating a specific object across consecutive frames in a video. In the realm of single object trackers, the initial frame serves as a reference, with the target object marked by a bounding rectangle. Subsequent frames then employ tracking algorithms to follow and trace the object's movement. Typically, these trackers are utilized alongside object detectors in real-world applications, combining the strengths of both technologies for enhanced accuracy and efficiency.

## Getting Start

Before you start this project, you may need to prepare your hardware and software in advance as described here.

### Hardware preparation

### Software Preparation

We recommend installing the **Bullesye** or **Bookworm**  version of Raspberry Pi 64 bit OS from their official website. If you prefer to install a new Raspbian OS, please follow the steps outlined in this [**guide**](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/reTerminal/#flash-raspberry-pi-os-64-bit-ubuntu-os-or-other-os-to-emmc). 

:::note

We highly recommend checking out our previous tutorial on [**Getting started with OpenCV**](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/reTerminal_DM_opencv/), as this tutorial serves as a continuation in our series.

## Tracking vs. Detection

In prior wikis, we covered [**face**](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/reTerminal_DM_Face_detection/) and [**color detection**](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/reTerminal_DM_Color_detection/), but noticed its intermittent nature. Here's a quick comparison:

1. **Speed Advantage:**
Tracking is faster than detection. By leveraging prior frame data, tracking algorithms predict object locations, whereas detection algorithms often start from scratch in each frame.
2. **Handling Failures:**
If a face detector falters due to occlusion, tracking algorithms excel. They can manage partial obstruction, offering robust performance when detection falls short.
3. **Identity Persistence:**
Object detection provides rectangles of detected objects but lacks identity persistence. Tracking excels in maintaining consistent object identity across frames, crucial for many real-world applications.

## What are the algorithms in Tracking domain?

Here are some major object tracking algorithms with their pros and cons 

**BOOSTING**
- Pros: Simple and real-time. Performs well with consistent motion.
- Cons: Struggles with complex motion patterns and occlusions.
- Speed: Fast.
- Accuracy: Moderate.

**MIL (Multiple Instance Learning)**
- Pros: Effective in handling occlusions and changes in object appearance.
- Cons: May be sensitive to noise and background clutter.
- Speed: Moderate.
- Accuracy: Good.

**KCF (Kernelized Correlation Filter)**
- Pros: High-speed performance. Robust against scale variations.
- Cons: Sensitive to out-of-view scenarios.
- Speed: Fast.
- Accuracy: Moderate to High.

**TLD (Tracking, Learning, and Detection)**
- Pros: Self-updating and capable of re-detecting lost objects.
- Cons: Prone to drift and may have difficulties with fast motion.
- Speed: Moderate.
- Accuracy: Moderate.

**MEDIANFLOW**
- Pros: Robust in handling abrupt motion changes and occlusions.
- Cons: May struggle with significant object appearance changes.
- Speed: Fast.
- Accuracy: Moderate.

**MOSSE (Minimum Output Sum of Squared Error)**
- Pros: Extremely fast and suitable for real-time applications.
- Cons: Limited robustness under challenging conditions.
- Speed: Very Fast.
- Accuracy: Moderate.

**CSRT (Channel and Spatial Reliability Tracker)**
- Pros: High accuracy and robustness against challenging scenarios.
- Cons: Computationally more expensive.
- Speed: Moderate.
- Accuracy: High.


## Let's run the code.

Make sure that you are in correct folder. If not 

 ```sh
cd Seeed_Python_ReTerminal/samples/Opencv_and_piCam

 ```
Then or Even you can use Thonny IDE to run the python script.

 ```sh
python Tracking.py
 ```

The Python script above is designed to track faces. The following code snippet handles the scenario where tracking fails, prompting the system to initiate a new detection process and vice versa. 

 ```sh
python DetectandTrack.py
 ```
