 #### HTTP Basic Authentication
  [HTTP Basic Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)is one of the most common ways for RESTfull API authentication. We use Access ID as username and Access Key as password. Every HTTP client library should have its built-in support for Basic Authentication, in this documentation we use curl, which uses the â€“user option to specify Basic Authentication credential.

  you can create access keys via SenseCAP Portal. Please refer to quickstart to see how to get an access key.

 #### API Response
 All response key follow the lowercase and underscore convention.

  #### Successful Response with String
  ```cpp
    {
       "code":"0",
       "data":"
           // string
       "
   }
  ```
  #### Successful Response with Object
  ```cpp
      {
       "code":"0",
