There are times when we use the wrong program to make XIAO appear to lose ports or not work properly. The specific performance is:

- Connected to computer, but no port number found for XIAO.

- The computer is connected and the port number appears, but the upload program fails.

In this Wiki, you can find solutions. Different models of XIAO have different troubleshooting methods, so please choose the corresponding solution for your model.

Here are the troubleshooting methods for upload failures, abnormal program behavior, or device port not found errors for various types of XIAO. You can quickly index through the link below:

## **For XIAO SAMD21**

Sometimes the Seeed Studio XIAO SAMD21 port may disappear when user programming process fails. we can solve this problem by the following operation:

### Reset

First, you can try to reset XIAO SAMD21. The steps are as follow:

- Connect the Seeed Studio XIAO SAMD21 to your computer.
- Use tweezers or short lines to short the RST pins **only once**
- The orange LED lights flicker on and light up.

:::note
The behavior of the built-in LED is reversed to the one on an Arduino. On the Seeed Studio XIAO SAMD21 , the pin has to be pulled low, whereas on other micro-controllers it has to be pulled high.

If that does not work, please try to enter **bootloader mode**:

### Enter Bootloader Mode

When you encounter the above two situations, you can try to put XIAO into BootLoader mode, which can solve most of the problems of unrecognized devices and failed uploads. The specific method is:  

- Connect the Seeed Studio XIAO SAMD21 to your computer.
- Use tweezers or short lines to short the RST pins in the diagram **twice**.
- The orange LED lights flicker on and light up.

At this point, the chip enters Bootloader mode and the burn port appears again. Because the samd21 chip has two partitions, one is the Bootloader and the other is the user program. The product will burn a bootloader code in the system memory when it leaves the factory. We can switch modes by performing the above steps.

If that also doesn't work, disconnect the board from the PC, and connect the board again.

## **For XIAO RP2040**

Sometimes the Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040 port may disappear when user programming process fails. We can solve this problem by the following operation:

### Reset

First, you can try to reset XIAO RP2040. The steps are as follow:

- Connect the Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040 to your computer.
- Press the "R" pins **once**.

:::note
The behavior of the built-in programmable Single-colour LEDs(two are blue, one is green) are reversed to the one on an Arduino. On the Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040, the pin has to be pulled low to enable.

If that does not work, please try to enter **bootloader mode**:

### Enter Bootloader Mode

When you encounter the above two situations, you can try to put XIAO into BootLoader mode, which can solve most of the problems of unrecognized devices and failed uploads. The specific method is:  

- Long press the "B" button.
- Connect the Seeed Studio XIAO PR2040 to your computer.
- The computer will appear a disk driver.

At this point, the chip enters Bootloader mode and the burn port appears again. Because the RP2040 chip has two partitions, one is the Bootloader and the other is the user program. The product will burn a bootloader code in the system memory when it leaves the factory. We can switch modes by performing the above steps.
