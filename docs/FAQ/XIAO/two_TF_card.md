A: This does not create a conflict. The different SD card slots are controlled via chip select, if you want to use the microSD card slot on Sense, the chip select pin should be **21**, if you want to use the microSD card slot on Round Display, the chip select pin should be **D2**.

We have [examples](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32s3_camera_usage/#project-i-making-a-handheld-camera) of using both hardware and microSD cards in the S3 Sense camera tutorial.
