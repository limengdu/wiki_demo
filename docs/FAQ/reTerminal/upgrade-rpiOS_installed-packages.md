We will update all the packages and also the Raspberry Pi OS to the latest version

### **Step 1.** Open a terminal window on the reTerminal and type the following

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
```

### **Step 2.** Reinstall kernel headers

```sh
sudo apt install raspberrypi-kernel-headers
