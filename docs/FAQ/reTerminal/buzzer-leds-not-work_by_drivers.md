<!-- Q13: LEDs and Buzzer do not work after installing reTerminal drivers -->

This issue will not last long. We will completely solve this issue later from reTerminal drivers itself

- **Step 1.** Open **/boot/config.txt**

```sh
sudo vi /boot/config.txt
```

- **Step 2.** Comment the following line and save the file by typing **:wq** after pressing **ESC**

```sh
#dtoverlay=reTerminal-bridge
```

- **Step 3.** Reboot reTerminal

```sh
sudo reboot
```

Now the LEDs and Buzzer will work as normal.
