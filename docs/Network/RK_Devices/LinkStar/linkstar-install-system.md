## Introduction

LinkStar-H68K router equips quad-core Cortex-A55 RK3568 chip, featuring 4 Ethernet interfaces for dual-2.5G and dual-1G, along with Wi-Fi 6 technology(optional), while providing high storage capacity and media player functionality. In this wiki we will show you how to install operating system with TF card or eMMC.

<div align="center"><img width={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LinkStar/25.png" /></div>

## Select the system you need for LinkStar

The powerful LinkStar supports a wide range of operating systems such as Android, Ubuntu, OpenWRT, Debian and many more. In this section, we will bring you the installation methods for each system.

### Notes & Instructions

LinkStar has two types of storage, one is **TF card** storage and the other is **eMMC** storage. Both memories are available for flash memory systems.

In this chapter, we can use the TF card with a card reader to flash the system to the TF card. Due to the read/write speed and stability, this way can only be flashed into the **OpenWRT** system.

- [Flash OpenWRT to the TF card](#jump1)

We can also flash the system to the eMMC that comes with the LinkStar. This method currently supports all supported operating systems from LinkStar.

- [Flash OpenWRT to eMMC](#jump2)
- [Flash Android / Ubuntu to eMMC](#jump3)

When a TF card is inserted in the LinkStar, the system in the TF card is the one that boots up when the system is turned on, as the **TF has priority to boot**.

### <span id="jump1">Flash OpenWRT to the TF card</span>

#### Preparation

- Windows/MacOS PC
- USB - C data cable
- A TF card
- A card reader
- [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) ‚Äî‚Äî Please download and install balenaEtcher, we will use this software to flash the system to a TF card.
- OpenWRT package

Please prepare the equipment required above, firmware update packages can be downloaded by clicking the download button below.

| Version | Description | Download |
|---------|----------|----------|
|  balenaEtcher  | - | [Download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/linkstar-h68k-os/files/Flash-to-TF-card-tool/) |
|  OpenWRT R22.11.18  | Add Docker support. | [Download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/linkstar-h68k-os/files/Openwrt/) |

:::caution
When using a TF card with LinkStar, it is important to note that it may be incompatible with some **high-speed cards**. If you are using a high speed card, you may experience data loading errors, boot-up errors or malfunctions during power-up and loading of the system due to the speed of the card.

The advantage of using a TF card is that different networks can be configured with different TF cards. It is also possible to have multiple systems - different systems can be used by replacing different TF cards.
:::

#### Procedure

**Step 1.** Connect the TF to the PC

Please put the TF into your prepared card reader and connect it to your PC.

**Step 2.** Flash the system onto a TF card

Open the balenaEtcher which has been installed in advance.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LinkStar/11.png" /></div>

Select the OpenWRT firmware you downloaded, it should end in **.img**.

<div align="center"><img width={700} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LinkStar/12.png" /></div>

Select the drive you want to flash the system to.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LinkStar/13.png" /></div>

Click the **Flash** button and the software will flash the system into your TF.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LinkStar/14.png" /></div>

:::caution
Some computers may prompt whether the USB device is not recognised after flashing the system and whether to format it, please **do not** reformat the card or the system inside will be erased.
:::

**Step 3.** Boot OpenWRT from the TF card

Remove the TF card from the card reader and insert it into the TF card slot of the LinkStar.

<div align="center"><img width={400} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LinkStar/15.png" /></div>

Then power up the LinkStar, you can choose to power it via **USB-C-5V** or via **DC-12V**.

When powered on, the LinkStar's power on button will light up in white. Press the power on button and the unit will power up and enter the system.

<div align="center"><img width={500} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LinkStar/16.png" /></div>

**Step 4.** Manage the OpenWRT backend

Use a network cable to connect to the ETH1/ETH2/ETH3 network port of the LinkStar. Then enter the address: `192.168.100.1` into your browser to access the admin backend.

:::caution
ETH0 is the WAN port and the other network ports are LAN ports. If you want to manage LinkStar's OpenWRT via a network cable, then connect the network cable to a LAN port other than ETH0.
