Time to build your real-time MIDI instrument/music player! It can play many format including MP3, WMA, WAV, AAC, MIDI, Ogg Vorbis. The Music Shield is an audio encoder/decoder compatible with Arduino, Seeeduino, Seeeduino Mega and Arduino Mega. It is based on the VC1053B chip, which enabled it to play sound files from SD card and do short-time recording as well. You can also use it to play MIDI notes by slightly changing its hardware installations. Due to the SPI communication mode, it keeps a minimum number of IO port that facilitates users’ own developments of this device. Additionally, the new multifunction button provides greater convenience for users to control.

:::note
The recording function works with Seeeduino Mega and Arduino Mega only. And the maximum size SD card you can use is 2GB.

:::note
<ol><li>If you want to use MIDI function, you need to change the hardware installation.</li>
<li>If you changed the hardware installation in order to use MIDI function, you are not able to use playback & recording functions until you restore it to the original condition.</li></ol>

### **Play music**

1. Make sure there are songs in the micro SD card.
2. Download [Music shield V2.0 library](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Music_Shield)
3. Unzip and copy the folder to Arduino’s library path: ..\arduino-1.0\libraries.

:::note

1. Change the folder name of the extracted library if Arduino throws an error while loading.<br />
2. Change the included header (to Arduino.h) in the example file if there is a `arduino.h: No such file or directory` error while compiling.
:::

**Demo 1: Play songs (e.g. in shuffle mode)**

In order to use the playback function, you need to create a playlist first.

1. Restart the Arduino IDE. Open “creatList” example via the path: File --> Examples --> MusicPlayer --> creatList as below.

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Music_Shield_V2.2/img/OpenCreatListCode.jpg" alt="pir" width={600} height="auto" /></p>

2. Set the play mode. In “creatList”, the function we use is described as follows.

    **Name:** setPlayMode(unsigned char playmode);

    **Function:** Set the play mode. There are four modes you can set: MODE_NORMAL, MODE_SHUFFLE, MODE_REPEAT_LIST, MODE_REPEAT_ONE. Each mode stands for different playing orders.

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Music_Shield_V2.2/img/Play_Mode.jpg" alt="pir" width={600} height="auto" /></p>

3. Select the type of Arduino board that you are using by the path: Tools --> Board --> for example Arduino UNO.
4. Select the correct serial port you are using by the path: Tools --> Serial Port --> for example COM3.
5. Upload the code. Click to Serial Monitor when “Done uploading” appears, you will find the order of songs is randomized on the list.

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Music_Shield_V2.2/img/Play_List.jpg" alt="pir" width={600} height="auto" /></p>

When multifunction button is pressed up or down, the volume will change. Of course, you can try others play modes.

**Demo 2: Play selected songs**

1. This demo will show you how to play part of the songs from all songs in the SD card. Open the “addToList” example via the path: File --> Examples --> MusicPlayer --> addToList.

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Music_Shield_V2.2/img/Select_play.jpg" alt="pir" width={600} height="auto" /></p>

2. Select songs from the playlist.You just need to list songs you want to play by name correctly in the function addToPlayList(char *songName) .
But you must ensure that the song has been stored in the SD card and the format of those songs must be one of MP3,WMA,WAV,AAC,MIDI,Ogg Vorbis.

3. Upload code. When you complete the upload,new add songs will be played.

**Demo 3: Control Volume by analog port**

1. Plug the Grove-Base Shield onto the Music shield, Connect the Grove socket of the Rotary and analog port 4 of the Base Shield with a Grove cable. You can change to the digital port as well. But don't forget to change the port number in the definition of the demo code at the same time.

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Music_Shield_V2.2/img/Music_shield_5.jpg" alt="pir" width={600} height="auto" /></p>

2. Open the “analogInputControl” example and upload it onto your Arduino Board.

3. Rotate the knob to change music volume.

**Demo 4: Record music:(Only support ATmega1280 and ATmega2560 based board)**

1. Upload any sketch in Music Shield library, for example the sketch "creatList". Open the Serial Monitor and it will play audio files on SD card.
2. Press down the multifunction button for 5 seconds, then the indicator LED will light off.
3. Press down the multifunction button for 5 seconds again, then the music shield will begin to record, the green indicator LED will blink.
4. Quickly press down the multifunction button again, it will stop recording.
5. Record will be played in the last place.

**Demo 5: Using MIDI**

1. This demo will show you how to play notes from 3.5mm using MIDI.Open the "MidiDemoPlayer" example via the path: File --> Examples --> MusicPlayer --> MidiDemoPlayer.

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Music_Shield_V2.2/img/Music_shield_midi_demo.jpeg" alt="pir" width={600} height="auto" /></p>

2. Upload Code to your arduino UNO.
